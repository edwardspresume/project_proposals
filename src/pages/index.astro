        <p>
            Welcome to Project Proposal, a site where you can share your project
            ideas, and see them come to life. If you have a vision for a
            website, a feature, browser extension, automation, desktop based
            tool that you want to create, I’m here to help you make it happen.
            On this site, you can check out some of the projects I’ve done
            before and pitch your project idea to me. If I like your idea and
            think it’s feasible, I’ll contact you and we can discuss the details
            further
        </p>
